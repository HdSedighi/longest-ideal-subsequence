# Intuition
The problem involves finding the longest subsequence of a string s such that the absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in the subsequence is less than or equal to k. A dynamic programming approach is suitable for this problem, as it allows us to keep track of the longest subsequence ending with each character.

# Approach
1. Use an array dp of size 26 (one for each lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z') to store the length of the longest ideal subsequence ending with each character.
2. Iterate through each character c in the string s.
3. For each character c, calculate its index in the alphabet (charIndex = c - 'a') and find the maximum length of an ideal subsequence ending with characters in the range of charIndex - k to charIndex + k using the dp array.
4. Update the value of dp[charIndex] based on the maximum length found plus 1 (for the current character).
5. Keep track of the overall maximum length found in the dp array.
6. Return the maximum length as the final result.
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.
This is because the algorithm iterates through each character in s and performs a constant amount of work for each character (updating the dp array).
- Space complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as the dp array is fixed in size (26 elements, one for each lowercase letter) and doesn't grow with the size of the input string.
